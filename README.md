# IAE-Psychology

IAE-Psychology is a repository that initiates the creation of IREX, a process that encompasses multiple explainability tools to improve the performance of machine learning or deep learning models by removing contradictory questions.

## Overview

The goal of IREX (Improving Model Performance through Removal of Contradictory Questions) is to enhance the interpretability and reliability of machine learning and deep learning models. By identifying and eliminating contradictory questions, IREX aims to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of these models in various applications.

## Features

- Integration of multiple explainability tools.
- Identification and removal of contradictory questions.
- Performance improvement for machine learning and deep learning models.

## Getting Started

To get started with IAE-Psychology and IREX, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Explore the provided examples and documentation.
4. Implement IREX in your own machine learning or deep learning projects.

## Usage

IAE-Psychology provides a set of tools and resources to support the IREX process. The main steps to use it are as follows:

1. Preprocess the dataset and extract the necessary features.
3. Train the model using the processes provided.
6. Evaluate the performance of the improved model.
